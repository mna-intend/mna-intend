## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a passionate **software developer** who loves clean, efficient code and crafting scalable solutions. Here's a bit more about me:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on **modern web applications** using **C#, React, and TypeScript**.  
- ðŸŒŸ I love turning complex ideas into **simple, elegant solutions** that just work.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about **TypeScript**, **C#**, or anything related to **modern web development**.  
- âš¡ Fun fact every developer knows: It worked yesterday.
- ðŸ’¡ Philosophy: "Code is not just what you write; itâ€™s what you leave behind."
- ðŸ˜ˆ Evil fun: Make error messages green.
